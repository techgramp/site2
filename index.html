      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>It was a leap of faith to leave the corporate
        world and begin pet grooming. It was my
        passion and I wanted to pursue it. I never
        looked back after receiving my Groomers
        Certification. The service industry was a
        perfect fit for me. I started grooming in
        Alpharetta, GA and was there for almost
        20 years. From puppies to senior dogs,
        and comfort grooms for the infirmed pets.
        I always enjoyed going to work. I
        understand the client, groomer, pet
        relationship. You want someone you can
        trust. Someone compassionate, someone
        in for the long term, someone with heart.
        Hey Dood Pet Grooming is proud to
        provide these services for Camden
        County.</p>
